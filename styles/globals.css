  Global styles

  This file pulls in Tailwind's layers and defines a handful of global
  utility classes and resets. Feel free to extend this file with your
  projectâ€‘wide styles, such as custom fonts loaded via @font-face or
  CSS variables. Avoid adding large blocks of component-specific CSS here;
  instead use Tailwind utility classes directly in your components.
